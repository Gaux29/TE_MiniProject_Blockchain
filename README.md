# Certificate Verification using Blockchain Technology

This project intends to implement a system that eliminates the need for people to approach the certificate issuing body to get their certificates verified.
The project uses blockchain technology in order to safely store a record of the certificate, for the recruiters and other educational institution to check its authenticity.

```shell
